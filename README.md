# BinaryToCPP

**Overview**

In previous activities, you converted code between C++, assembly, and binary while retaining functionality. Now you are ready to take the next step by identifying the functions of legacy code, converting that code into a workable form in assembly, and converting assembly to C++. This real-life task will help you gain the skills you need for the successful completion of Project One, which is centered on working with legacy code. The coding for this assignment will be performed in Codio. You will submit the completed Binary to C++ Activity Template Word Docuument, as well as a new binary file and CPP file.

**Prompt**

For this assignment, you are given four legacy binary files. Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria for each binary file:

Convert the binary file to assembly code.
These files can be found in the Software Reverse Engineering Playground in the Module Four file folder in Codio.
Explain the functionality of the blocks of assembly code.
Use the Binary to C++ Activity Template to complete this step.
Convert the assembly code to binary.
Create a new binary file for submission.
Convert the assembly code to C++ code.
Use the Binary to C++ Activity Template to complete this step.
Compile the C++ code in the Eclipse integrated development environment.
Explain how the C++ code performs the same tasks as the blocks of assembly code.
Use the Binary to C++ Activity Template to complete this step.
